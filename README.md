Welcome to the repository for the code used in the analysis of our master's thesis titled "**The Influence of Inquisitiveness and Learning Approach on Negotiation Effectiveness and Efficiency: A Close-Up on the Pillars of Openness**". This research was conducted as part of the requirements for the Master's in Management at ESMT European School of Management and Technology, Berlin, authored by Mansi Singh and Linda Henkel.

The aim of this thesis is to investigate the connection between openness, represented by the sub-traits of inquisitiveness and learning approach, and the effectiveness and efficiency of negotiations. For this purpose, we formulated the following research questions:

1.	“How do inquisitiveness and learning approach influence the parameters of effectiveness and efficiency within an integrative negotiation?”
   
3.	“Which trait, inquisitiveness or learning approach, has the stronger impact on effectiveness and efficiency in integrative negotiations?“

Specifically, the research intends to study the correlation between different levels of inquisitiveness and learning approach and their impact on negotiation outcomes. The following hypotheses will be tested:

**H1**: Negotiators with a higher level of inquisitiveness will exhibit greater effectiveness and efficiency in integrative negotiations compared to those with a lower level of inquisitiveness.

**H2**: Negotiators achieving higher scores on the learning approach scale will demonstrate greater effectiveness and efficiency in integrative negotiations than those located on the lower end of the learning approach scale.

**H3**: Inquisitiveness has a stronger impact on the effectiveness and efficiency of integrative negotiations than learning approach.
